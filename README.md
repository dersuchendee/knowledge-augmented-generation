# A Knowledge Augmented Generation Approach to Enhance Multimodal Analogical Reasoning


This work  introduces a Knowledge-Augmented Generation (KAG) framework that combines knowledge graphs with Conceptual Blending-inspired prompts to capture implicit analogies. Applied to metaphor detection tasks, it outperforms baselines, enhances explainability, and even exceeds human performance in understanding visual metaphors.
